## Project Context  

I want to clarify my approach for this assignment:  

- I do not have much prior knowledge about **trading or financial concepts**.  
- To complete this assignment, I did **research on the internet** and learned the basics about terminologies.  
- I applied the concepts to the **best of my understanding**.
